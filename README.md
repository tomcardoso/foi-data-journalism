This is the repository for a talk on marrying freedom of information requests and data journalism to report on criminal justice in Canada. The slides can be found here: https://tomcardoso.github.io/foi-data-journalism/

This talk was originally given at the University of Winnipeg's [Centre for Access to Information and Justice](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/caij/) on February 26, 2020. Here's a brief description:

> All too often, data used in criminal justice research and reporting comes from one of a handful of sources: Statistics Canada, open data portals, or a polite request to a government body. Unfortunately, these datasets are always summarized and aggregated, stamping out interesting patterns. But with a bit of strategy (and a whole lot of patience), freedom of information (FOI) requests can get you right to the source – the database itself. This talk will explore how to request these large, closely-guarded datasets through FOIs, summarize the ways these datasets can be analyzed, and provide examples of the kind of findings that are possible when you go right to the source.
